# DarkModeFixer
DarkModeFixer is a simple chrome extension for my own personal use.
-Used chrome://flags#enable-force-dark which occasionally turns things ugly (tier list icons)
-Idea to incorporate element picker into an extension that reverses darkmode (saw from ublock)
-Initial V1.0 flips the whole page
-(Add gifs and such to illustrate these points, learn how to do this on markdown files)
-Was there an easier way? Probably. But this was a great opportunity to practice some javascript/html!
-Did you know the transformations involved in inversing these colours are irreversible? Try it out by flipping it back!
